#Prime Prestudy 5

Your task this week is to clean up this object, making sure all the proper syntax and other needed components are included.

Once you have worked through the Object and corrected it, create an html file (index.html) that pulls in the Javascript file (script.js) and console logs out the object. Once you have completed that, check the project into GitHub under a repo called 'prime_prestudy_05'.
